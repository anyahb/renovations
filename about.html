    <div class="who__title">Who we are</div>
    <div class="who__text">Once you work with Andie, we’re your home improvement pro for life. Our design-build team
        completes remodels and renovations of all shapes and sizes, but when our clients kept coming back to us with
        more work, we realized there was the need to provide services to our community beyond remodels and renovations.
        Thus, Andie Paints was born!

                We loved working with Andie! From zeroing in on a color to the day the doors went back on, it was great. Excellent communication and attention to detail. She is also super friendly and just a joy to work with.

                Andie was amazing! She updated my kitchen cabinets from a dark and boring wood to pure white. The process was quick, and my kitchen now looks brighter and feels airy. She was a pleasure to work with.
